# Configuring cinc

This is the complete reference for how `cinc` finds and reads your
credentials. If you're coming from knife or Chef Workstation, start with
[Migrating from Chef](migrating-from-chef.md) for the quick path, then
come back here when you want the full picture.

## The credentials file

`cinc` keeps its connection settings in a single
[TOML](https://toml.io) file. By default that's `~/.cinc/credentials`,
the same shape and location convention as Chef's `~/.chef/credentials`.
Point at a different file per command with the global `--config` flag:

```sh
cinc node list --config /path/to/credentials
```

The file holds one or more **profiles**. A profile is a named bundle of
everything needed to talk to one server (or one Supermarket): a server
URL, a client identity, a signing key, and a handful of optional
settings. Each top-level TOML table is a profile, and the table name is
the profile name:

```toml
[default]
cinc_server_url = "https://cinc.example.com/organizations/acme"
client_name     = "tim"
client_key      = "/keys/tim.pem"

[staging]
cinc_server_url = "https://staging.example.com/organizations/acme-staging"
client_name     = "tim"
client_key      = "/keys/staging.pem"
ssl_verify_mode = ":verify_none"
```

You can keep as many profiles as you like in one file — a default, a
staging server, a Supermarket-only identity — and choose between them
per command. See [Selecting a profile](#selecting-a-profile) below.

## Every configuration key

All keys are strings. Only `client_name`, `client_key`, and a server
endpoint are needed for a normal server profile; everything else is
optional.

| Key | Meaning | Required? | Default | Chef-compat equivalent | Related flag / env |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `cinc_server_url` | Server URL, including the `/organizations/<org>` segment | Yes (or a Supermarket site) | — | `chef_server_url` | `--server-url` / `--cinc-server-url` |
| `client_name` | Client/user name requests are signed as | Yes | — | (same key) | `--client-name` |
| `client_key` | Path to the RSA private key (PEM) used to sign requests | Yes | — | (same key) | `--client-key` |
| `ssl_verify_mode` | TLS verification: `:verify_peer` or `:verify_none` | No | `:verify_peer` | (same key) | `--ssl-verify-mode` |
| `secret_file` | Path to the default encrypted data bag secret | No | — | (same key) | `--secret-file`, `$CINC_SECRET_FILE` / `$CHEF_SECRET_FILE` |
| `supermarket_site` | Supermarket instance the `cinc supermarket` commands target | No | `https://supermarket.chef.io` | (same key) | `--supermarket-site` |
| `supermarket_client_name` | Username used to sign Supermarket uploads | No | falls back to `client_name` | none (cinc-only) | — |
| `supermarket_key` | Path to the key used to sign Supermarket uploads | No | falls back to `client_key` | none (cinc-only) | — |

> The chef-prefixed `chef_server_url` is accepted everywhere
> `cinc_server_url` is. When both appear in the same profile, the
> cinc-prefixed value wins. When `cinc` writes a profile — via `cinc
> config create` or first-run migration — it emits the cinc-canonical
> `cinc_server_url`, but it keeps reading `chef_server_url`, so existing
> and knife-shared files load unchanged. See
> [Migrating from Chef](migrating-from-chef.md#chef--and-cinc-prefixed-keys)
> for the full duality story.

### `cinc_server_url` and the organization split

The server URL must include the `/organizations/<org>` segment, exactly
as knife expects it:

```toml
cinc_server_url = "https://cinc.example.com/organizations/acme"
```

`cinc` splits that into a bare server URL (`https://cinc.example.com`)
and an organization (`acme`) internally — you never configure the two
separately. A URL without the `/organizations/<org>` segment is
reported as an error by `cinc config validate` (see
[Validating a profile](#cinc-config-validate)).

A profile that only talks to Supermarket — never to a Cinc Server — can
omit the server URL entirely and set `supermarket_site` instead.

### `client_name` and `client_key`

`client_name` is the identity the server knows you by; `client_key` is
the path to that identity's RSA private key in PEM form. `cinc` reads
the key to sign every request — it's never uploaded. A leading `~` in
the path is expanded to your home directory. If the key file is missing
or unreadable, `cinc` tells you which path it tried and which profile
pointed there.

### `ssl_verify_mode`

Controls TLS certificate verification when talking to the server. Two
values are accepted:

- `:verify_peer` (the default) — verify the server's certificate, as
  you'd want in production.
- `:verify_none` — skip verification. Handy against a lab server with a
  self-signed certificate, but don't ship it.

Any other value is rejected by `cinc config validate`. The leading
colon matches knife's Ruby-symbol spelling.

### `secret_file` and encrypted data bags

`secret_file` points at the shared key used to encrypt and decrypt
**encrypted data bag items** (`cinc databag secret …`). It's the
per-profile default; an individual command can always override it. When
a `cinc databag secret` command needs the secret, it resolves one from
the first source that's set, in this order:

1. `--secret <literal>` — the flag value is the secret, used verbatim.
2. `--secret-file <path>` — the file's full contents are the secret.
3. `$CINC_SECRET_FILE`, then `$CHEF_SECRET_FILE` (cinc wins).
4. the profile's `secret_file` key.

`--secret` and `--secret-file` can't be combined. The file's bytes are
used exactly as written — never trimmed — because Chef treats the whole
file as the key, so an existing `encrypted_data_bag_secret` works
unchanged. The on-disk key name matches knife's `knife[:secret_file]`.

### `supermarket_site` and the upload identity

`supermarket_site` sets which Supermarket instance the `cinc
supermarket` commands talk to. It defaults to the public
`https://supermarket.chef.io`; set it to point at a private Supermarket.

By default, `cinc supermarket share` signs uploads with the profile's
own `client_name` and `client_key` — the same identity it uses against
your Cinc Server. The public Supermarket usually wants a *different*
identity (your Supermarket account, not your Chef client), so two
optional keys let you override it:

- `supermarket_client_name` — the Supermarket username uploads are
  signed as.
- `supermarket_key` — path to the private key used to sign uploads.

Each falls back **independently**: the effective username is
`supermarket_client_name` or, when unset, `client_name`; the effective
key is `supermarket_key` or, when unset, `client_key`. So you can
override just the username, just the key, or both. When neither is set,
uploads use `client_name`/`client_key`. These are **cinc-only** keys —
knife has no equivalent, so there's no chef-prefixed pairing.

## Selecting a profile

When a command needs a profile and you don't name one, `cinc` picks one
in this order, stopping at the first that's set:

1. the `--profile <name>` flag
2. the `$CINC_PROFILE` environment variable
3. the `$CHEF_PROFILE` environment variable
4. the profile literally named `default`

```sh
cinc node list                      # uses [default]
cinc node list --profile staging    # uses [staging]
CINC_PROFILE=staging cinc role list # sticky for the shell
```

When both `$CINC_PROFILE` and `$CHEF_PROFILE` are set, `CINC_PROFILE`
wins — the same cinc-over-chef rule that applies to the config keys.

> The `cinc supermarket` commands resolve a profile slightly
> differently: with no `--profile` or profile env var, they prefer a
> profile literally named `supermarket`, falling back to `default`.
> This lets you keep your public-Supermarket identity in its own
> `[supermarket]` profile without it shadowing your server profile.

## Environment variables

| Variable | Effect | Cinc wins over |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `CINC_PROFILE` | Selects the active profile | `CHEF_PROFILE` |
| `CHEF_PROFILE` | Selects the active profile (chef-compat) | — |
| `CINC_SECRET_FILE` | Default encrypted data bag secret path | `CHEF_SECRET_FILE` |
| `CHEF_SECRET_FILE` | Default encrypted data bag secret path (chef-compat) | — |
| `NO_COLOR` | Disables bold/colored terminal styling | — |

## Global flags

These persistent flags work on every command:

| Flag | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `--config` | Path to the credentials file (default `~/.cinc/credentials`) |
| `--profile` | Profile to use (default: `$CINC_PROFILE`, then `$CHEF_PROFILE`, then `default`) |
| `--format` | Output format: `human` (default) or `json` |

## Creating and editing profiles

### `cinc config create`

`cinc config create` writes a profile into your credentials file. With
no flags it runs an interactive walkthrough, prompting for each value
and offering a sensible default you can accept with Enter:

```sh
cinc config create
```

If the credentials file already has profiles, it asks whether to add a
new one, update an existing one, or replace the file. Pass `--config`
to write somewhere other than `~/.cinc/credentials`, and `--profile` to
name the profile.

Supply any of the setup flags and it runs **non-interactively** instead,
which is what you want in scripts:

```sh
cinc config create \
  --profile staging \
  --cinc-server-url https://staging.example.com/organizations/acme-staging \
  --client-name tim \
  --client-key ~/.cinc/staging.pem \
  --ssl-verify-mode :verify_none
```

The available flags are:

| Flag | Sets |
| --- | --- |
| `--server-url` / `--cinc-server-url` / `--chef-server-url` | the server URL (all three are aliases) |
| `--supermarket-site` | `supermarket_site` |
| `--client-name` | `client_name` |
| `--client-key` | `client_key` |
| `--ssl-verify-mode` | `ssl_verify_mode` |

In non-interactive mode `--client-name` and `--client-key` are
required. `config create` writes TOML only — `cinc` never emits Ruby
`config.rb`/`client.rb` files.

> `config create` does **not** have flags for `secret_file`,
> `supermarket_client_name`, or `supermarket_key`. Add those by editing
> the credentials file directly — it's plain TOML. Note also that
> rewriting a profile through `config create` does not preserve comments
> or the original key ordering in the file.

### `cinc config validate`

`cinc config validate` runs local pre-flight checks against your
credentials, and pings each server to confirm it's reachable. It checks
that:

- the file is valid TOML,
- every profile has a `client_name` and a `client_key`,
- each profile has a usable endpoint (`cinc_server_url`,
  `chef_server_url`, or `supermarket_site`),
- any server URL includes the `/organizations/<org>` segment,
- `ssl_verify_mode`, when set, is `:verify_peer` or `:verify_none`,
- `supermarket_site`, when set, is a valid URL,
- and each configured server actually answers (reporting its TLS
  posture as its own check).

```sh
cinc config validate            # checks ~/.cinc/credentials
cinc config validate ./creds    # checks a specific file
cinc config validate --format json
```

It's local-and-reachability only — it never modifies your config. If a
check fails, `cinc config create` will let you fix the profile.

## Worked examples

### A basic single-profile setup

```toml
[default]
cinc_server_url = "https://cinc.example.com/organizations/acme"
client_name     = "tim"
client_key      = "/keys/tim.pem"
```

### A default plus a lab/staging profile

The staging server uses a self-signed certificate, so it disables TLS
verification:

```toml
[default]
cinc_server_url = "https://cinc.example.com/organizations/acme"
client_name     = "tim"
client_key      = "/keys/tim.pem"
secret_file     = "/keys/encrypted_data_bag_secret"

[staging]
cinc_server_url = "https://staging.example.com/organizations/acme-staging"
client_name     = "tim"
client_key      = "/keys/staging.pem"
ssl_verify_mode = ":verify_none"
```

```sh
cinc node list                     # production
cinc node list --profile staging   # the lab server
```

### Talking to a server and publishing to the public Supermarket

This profile uses your normal Chef client against your Cinc Server, but
overrides the identity for `cinc supermarket share` so cookbooks publish
under your public Supermarket account. It also sets a default encrypted
data bag secret:

```toml
[default]
cinc_server_url         = "https://cinc.example.com/organizations/acme"
client_name             = "tim"
client_key              = "/keys/tim.pem"
secret_file             = "/keys/encrypted_data_bag_secret"
supermarket_client_name = "tim-public"
supermarket_key         = "/keys/supermarket.pem"
```

```sh
cinc node list                       # signed as "tim" against your server
cinc supermarket share my_cookbook   # signed as "tim-public" to Supermarket
```
