## cinc policy-group acl grant

Add members to a permission

### Synopsis

Add users, clients, or groups to one permission's ACE (or all five with `all`).

<perm> is one of create, read, update, delete, grant, or all.
--user and --client both target the ACE's actor list (the server treats users
and clients as one actor namespace); --group targets its group list. Each flag is
repeatable, and at least one is required.

```
cinc policy-group acl grant <perm> <name> [flags]
```

### Examples

Grant a group read access to policy-group production.

```bash
cinc policy-group acl grant read production --group admins
```

### Options

```
      --client stringArray   client to add or remove (repeatable; targets the actor list)
      --group stringArray    group to add or remove (repeatable; targets the group list)
  -h, --help                 help for grant
      --user stringArray     user to add or remove (repeatable; targets the actor list)
```
