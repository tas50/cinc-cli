## cinc org acl

Manage the ACL of the current organization

### Synopsis

Manage the access-control list (ACL) of this object.

A Chef ACL grants five permissions — create, read, update, delete, and grant —
to actors (users and clients) and to groups. Editing an ACL requires an
identity that already holds the grant permission on the object.

The org ACL is the organization object's own ACL. It applies to whichever org the current profile's server URL points at; switch --profile to manage another.

### Options

```
  -h, --help   help for acl
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

```
      --config string    path to the Cinc credentials file (default ~/.cinc/credentials)
      --format string    output format: human or json (default "human")
      --profile string   credentials profile to use (default: $CINC_PROFILE, then $CHEF_PROFILE, then "default")
```
