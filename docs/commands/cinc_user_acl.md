## cinc user acl

Manage the ACL of a user

### Synopsis

Manage the access-control list (ACL) of this object.

A Chef ACL grants five permissions — create, read, update, delete, and grant —
to actors (users and clients) and to groups. Editing an ACL requires an
identity that already holds the grant permission on the object.

User ACLs are global, not org-scoped — they live at the server root, so they need an identity with grant permission on the user object itself.

### Options

```
  -h, --help   help for acl
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

```
      --config string    path to the Cinc credentials file (default ~/.cinc/credentials)
      --format string    output format: human or json (default "human")
      --profile string   credentials profile to use (default: $CINC_PROFILE, then $CHEF_PROFILE, then "default")
```
