## cinc org member

List, add, or remove members of the current org

### Synopsis

Manage the membership of the organization your profile points at.

These verbs are organization-scoped — they act on whichever org the current
profile's server URL targets, not on an org named on the command line. To
manage a different org, switch profiles with --profile.

### Options

```
  -h, --help   help for member
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

```
      --config string    path to the Cinc credentials file (default ~/.cinc/credentials)
      --format string    output format: human or json (default "human")
      --profile string   credentials profile to use (default: $CINC_PROFILE, then $CHEF_PROFILE, then "default")
```
