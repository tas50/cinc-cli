## cinc org

Manage organizations on the Cinc Server

### Synopsis

Manage organizations on the Cinc Server.

The list, show, create, edit, and delete verbs talk to the server root
(/organizations), so they need a pivotal (superuser) identity, the kind of
account that signs the server's own administrative requests. Point a profile at
such an identity to use them.

The member and invite subgroups are organization-scoped: they act on whichever
org the current profile's server URL points at. knife takes the org as an
explicit argument; cinc derives it from your profile instead, so to manage a
different org, switch profiles with --profile.

### Options

```
  -h, --help   help for org
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

```
      --config string    path to the Cinc credentials file (default ~/.cinc/credentials)
      --format string    output format: human or json (default "human")
      --profile string   credentials profile to use (default: $CINC_PROFILE, then $CHEF_PROFILE, then "default")
```
